Each folder contains the same structure, but each running different filters.
- Extended Kalman Filter, for state estimation.
- Joint Extended Kalman Filter, for state and parameter estimation.
- Dual Extended Kalman Filter, for state and parameter estimation.


IMPORTANT NOTE 1: Run the measurementGenerator script first to generate the measurement data required by the filter. 
IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Also, Ensure that the parameters in both measurementGenerator and massSpring scripts are the same.

-massSpring*  -  This script is the main script that initialises the covariances and runs the filter.
-measurementGenerator* - This script generates the measurement data required by the filter in the massSpring script.

-force.m - This function generates an input force that is fed to the system.
-k_varying.m - This function generates a varying stiffness that is fed to the system.

-shadedErrorBar - This function can be used to visualise the plots along with covariances.

-dynamicFunctions/ This folder consists of the functions that is passed to the filter as function handles - process models and measurement models
-plots/ This folder, currently, stores manually saved plots from the filter results. A function can be written to plot and save figures automatically.
-robotData/ This folder is used to save the measurement.mat generated by measurementGeneratr script.
-symbolicFunctions/ - consists of the symbolic.m script which is used to generate the process ODE and measurement model files. Start with symbolic.m this folder to build the filter.
-utils/ consists of the EKF functions from the EKF/UKF toolbox used to run the filter.
